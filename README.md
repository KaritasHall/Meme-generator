# Meme generator with React

The meme generator consists of a basic input form and an image that is randomly grabbed from an API.
The user can type in their own text for the meme, which is updated and rendered in real time. By using the
useState hook the "state" of the meme object is re-rendered everytime a change is made to the component - allowing
us to see input changes immediately.

We have two main components, Head and Meme. They each have their own styles.js where their styled components
are stored.
